# Drug-target-bioactivity-prediction
Diseases alter the human body at the cellular level, disturbing cell functions, and even its viability, and consequently can disturb one or several organs or cause death.
These changes happen by disturbing protein functions in the cell, as cellular proteins carry almost all human body functions.
To fix the disturbance, proteins are typically targeted by drugs (chemical compounds) to produce a certain therapeutic effect.
However, there are millions of drugs, making it impractical in terms of cost and time to test all possible drugs in order to find 
which drug can target a protein of interest (involved in a specific disease). Finding effective drugs in this blind search manner can take years and even decades.
To overcome this problem, we built a machine learning model that takes as input measurements of cellular response to a drug (gene expression and cell viability) 
and predicts whether that drug would be effective to target a human protein of interest. This model can help accelerate the drug-target identification process and save time needed
to find potential drugs for certain diseases.
